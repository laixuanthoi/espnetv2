#  ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains the source code that we used for semantic segmentation in our paper of our paper, [ESPNetv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11431).

***Note:*** New segmentation models for the PASCAL VOC and the Cityscapes are coming soon. Our new models achieves mIOU of [68.0](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/anonymous/DAMVRR.html) and [66.15](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/anonymous-results/?id=2267c613d55dd75d5301850c913b1507bf2f10586ca73eb8ebcf357cdcf3e036) on the PASCAL VOC and the Cityscapes test sets, respectively. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE** We released a new repository EdgeNets that contains our work on efficient network design. See [EdgeNets](https://github.com/sacmehta/EdgeNets/) for performance comparison and pretrained models.
